Update as of 1.3.2021: This project is stale. I won't be continuing developing this project. Some things to consider:

- The Class Layout is not optimal, and this barely works.
- OpenGL is deeply tied into the Code. It should be more contained, so that support for other backends can be added, such as Vulkan, or even DirectX12
- Overall the coordinate system is not implemented right in this. Maybe using a child/parent system would be better?
- There should be a 2d overlay
- There should be settings
- There should be an easy mechanism to flag a variable as a setting, and add it to the settings menu.

# OpenGLGame
This Repository is an attempt at making a Game using largely my own Code.

Therefore the Project may take a while to update. 

## Game Details
I currently have no idea, about, what this is Game is going to be.

I do know these things:
- [x] I want 3D support
- [x] I want Text support
- [x] Rotation in x,y and z
- [x] Movement should be allowed in all 3 Dimensions
- [ ] maybe 5 depending on the Game?
- [x] There should be different objects
- [ ] There should be a way to color Objects in ANY way (using Texture maps)
- [ ] There should be collision between Objects
- [x] There should be multiple Coordinate Systems (not just the OpenGL one)
