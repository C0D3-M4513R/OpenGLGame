# OpenGLGame
This Repository is an attempt at making a Game using largely my own Code.

Therefore the Project may take a while to update. 

## Game Details
I currently have no idea, about, what this is Game is going to be.

I do know these things:
- [x] I want 3D support
- [x] I want Text support
- [x] Rotation in x,y and z
- [x] Movement should be allowed in all 3 Dimensions
- [ ] maybe 5 depending on the Game?
- [x] There should be different objects
- [ ] There should be a way to color Objects in ANY way (using Texture maps)
- [ ] There should be collision between Objects
- [x] There should be multiple Coordinate Systems (not just the OpenGL one)
